iter(iterable) vs iter(iterator)
Calling iter on an iterable multiple times returns a new
iterator each time with distinct states (otherwise, you'd never be able
 to iterate through a iterable more than once). You can also call iter
 on the iterator itself, which will just return the same iterator without
  changing its state.
